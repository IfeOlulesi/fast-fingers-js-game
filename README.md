# Fast Fingers JS Game
A JavaScript-based game I created back in 2019 on Sololearn. I decided to make it live

View the project on Sololearn [here](https://www.sololearn.com/compiler-playground/W76hZonF527a) 

## Gameplay
The goal of the game is straightforward.
Random shapes appear on your screen at random times. Click on the shapes as quickly as possible when they appear on your screenðŸ˜‰

Good luck!ðŸŽŠ

## Future Ideas & Contribution
Right now, the game is very simple and minimal. Here are some ideas / next steps

1. Levels and Rewards
2. User accounts to keep track of high scores
3. Global Leaderboards
4. Various UI improvements
